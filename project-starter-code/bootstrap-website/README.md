# Bootstrap Website

### Overview

For this project, you'll create a website using Bootstrap. Your page can be about any topic.

### Make it YOURS

1. Everything about the template provided should be changed to your liking. Feel free to add and/or change the bootstrap components. **Remember** you can overwrite the Bootstrap styles using CSS!

2. Don't forget to change the page title in the head. As well as the text in the footer.

#### A Tip

1. When you encounter bugs (and we all do), `console.log` will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.

   - As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the [Chrome DevTools Debugger](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
