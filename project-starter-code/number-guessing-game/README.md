# Guessing Game

### Overview

For this project, you'll use Javascript to create a guessing game, using numbers or letters.

## Game Play

Your game should:

- Include: variables, comparisons, & prompts
- Continue until the correct answer is guessed [HINT: use a while loop]
- Notify user of win, loss, or game over using alerts or the console.log

##### Guess Game Bonuses

- Have the app choose a random number or letter, instead of hard-coding the secret guess.
- Instead of using prompts, write to the DOM.
- When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
- When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
- Write some stylish CSS rules to make a design that fits your game's theme.
- Play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly, like in our demo.

#### A Tip

1. When you encounter bugs (and we all do), `console.log` will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.

   - As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the [Chrome DevTools Debugger](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
