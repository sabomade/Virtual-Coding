# 1pg Website

### Overview

For this project, you'll create a 1pg website using HTML & CSS. Your page can be about any topic and should include various HTML tags, links, and images.

### Make it YOURS

1. Everything about the template provided should be changed to your liking. Have fun and experiment with the CSS!

2. Don't forget to change the page title in the head. As well as the text in the footer.

#### A Tip

1. When you encounter bugs (and we all do), `console.log` will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.

   - As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the [Chrome DevTools Debugger](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
