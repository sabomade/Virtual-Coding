# Using Divs

### Overview

For this project, you'll create a 1pg website focusing on using Divs. Play with styling each div, **remember** to use classes!

### Make it YOURS

1. Everything about the template provided should be changed to your liking. Have fun and experiment with FLEX!

2. Don't forget to change the page title in the head. As well as the text in the footer.

#### A Few Tips

1. When you encounter bugs (and we all do), `console.log` will become your best friend. Regularly check your console to make sure your app is spitting out the right values.

   - As a more advanced—but more powerful—alternative, feel free to experiment with the [Chrome DevTools Debugger](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).

2. Reveiw how to use Flex with this game, [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) or read this article, [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
